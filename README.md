## Spring 2021
The goal of this project was to create a e-commerace application that had the following features
1. User Login and Registration Form
2. Create a Product Catalog and Product Search
3. Establish User Roles: Admin - User and Product Administration
4. Maintain a Shopping Cart
5. Perform a Checkout Process
6. Generate Sales Reports for Users and Admin - Export JSON
7. Add Customization - Discounts and Tax/Shipping


Due to a lack of forward thinking on my part and a lack of basic understanding, a lot of the code is unorganized and a mess. While the project works to the requirements of my professor, it does not look or meet the feel that I would like to display on github.

This page will be getting updates as I continue to learn and modify this website to meet my own standards as I learn and grow in the world of web-design and software develemont.
